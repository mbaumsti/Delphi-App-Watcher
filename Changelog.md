# Changelog  

## 🚀 v2.0.0 - 09/03/2025  

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes  
- **`TAppWatcherMessage` structure updated**:  
  - `Handle` is now a `UInt64` instead of `HWnd` for **better compatibility across 32/64-bit systems**.  
  - **Record become Packed record**, modifying the message memory layout.  
  - ⚠ **Older versions will not be able to communicate with v2.0.0**.  
- **Protocol version update required**: Ensure **all components (Master, Agent, Client)** use the **same version**.  

### ✨ Added  
- **🚀 Application Deployment Management (`AppWatcherMaster_Deploy.pas`)**  
  - New feature to **deploy applications**.  
  - Allows **selecting applications to copy** from a source directory to destination paths.  
  - Fully integrated with the Master UI.  

- **📂 Application list sorting & filtering**  
  - Click on column headers to **sort** application lists.  
  - Toggle filtering to display **only applications marked for deployment**.  

- **🖥️ Auto-selection of added applications**  
  - When adding an application to the deployment list, it is **automatically selected** in the UI.  


### 🛠 Fixed & Improved  
- **Master now verify its role regularly** `Check if the MASTER is still the MASTER`.  
- **Agent Fixes:**  
  - `HandleCLIENTAckReply` now correctly **transmits parameters** (`StopDialog.Params := Msg.Params`).  
  - **INI file is now only reloaded if modified** to prevent unnecessary reads.  
- **Component Improvements:**  
  - `FindParentForm` logic refined for better UI hierarchy detection.  
  - `FLastCommand` is now properly set when commands are executed.  
- **Client Example Enhancements:**  
  - Uses `getCmdName` for better command interpretation.  
  - Added **radio buttons** to simulate acceptance/refusal of application shutdown.  
  - Displays transmitted parameters to demonstrate **start/stop messaging**.  


### 🔄 Upgrade Notes  
1. **Ensure all instances (Master, Agent, Client) are updated** to **v2.0.0**.  
2. **Update integrations** that rely on `TAppWatcherMessage` due to **structure changes**.  
3. **Reconfigure deployment settings** via the new `Deploy Manager` UI.
